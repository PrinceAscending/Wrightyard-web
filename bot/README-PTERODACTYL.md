# Wrightyard bot on Pterodactyl

This package is the complete Wrightyard bot: the Discord gateway, the ticket
ledger, the website heartbeat, and the Groq-powered `/ask` and `/brief`
commands.

## 1. Create the server

Use a **Node.js** egg on Node **22.12 or newer**. A 1 GB RAM / 1 vCPU server is
plenty. The bot needs one long-running process and no inbound web traffic.

Set the startup command to one of these:

```text
sh start.sh
```

or, if the panel does not allow shell wrappers:

```text
node dist/index.js
```

`start.sh` uses Pterodactyl's `SERVER_PORT` for the local health endpoint and
installs production dependencies the first time if `node_modules` is missing.

## 2. Upload the files

1. Open **File Manager** for the server.
2. Upload the zip.
3. Extract it **into the server root**. The root must contain `package.json`,
   `dist/`, `start.sh`, and `README-PTERODACTYL.md` directly. If the zip
   extracts into a folder, move its contents up one level.
4. Delete the zip after extraction if the panel has a tight disk quota.

## 3. Create `.env`

Create a file named `.env` in the server root. Copy the values from the
`.env` file on the machine where the bot was built. Do **not** put these values
in a public repository or paste them into chat.

Required:

```dotenv
DISCORD_TOKEN=...
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=...
OWNER_ID=...
SITE_URL=https://wrightyard.vercel.app
BOT_HEARTBEAT_SECRET=...
MONGODB_URI=...
MONGODB_DB=wrightyard
GROQ_API_KEY=...
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=production
```

Optional but already used by the current yard:

```dotenv
ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID=...
TICKET_PANEL_CHANNEL_ID=...
TICKET_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=...
STAFF_ROLE_IDS=...
TICKET_CATEGORY_ID=...
```

`BOT_HEARTBEAT_SECRET` must be the exact same value as the website's
`BOT_HEARTBEAT_SECRET` in Vercel. If it differs, the bot runs but the website
will keep showing it as offline.

If the panel lets you define environment variables in the **Startup** tab, you
can use that instead of `.env`. Process environment variables win over `.env`.

## 4. First start

Start the server and watch the console. A healthy boot looks like this:

```text
INFO  [bot] Commands loaded {"count":8,...}
INFO  [bot] AI bench ready {"model":"openai/gpt-oss-20b"}
INFO  [bot] Gateway ready ...
INFO  [bot] Yard located ...
INFO  [bot:tickets] Ticket ledger rehydrated ...
INFO  [bot:heartbeat] Website heartbeat started ...
INFO  [bot:heartbeat] Website heartbeat accepted
```

If `node_modules` was not included in the zip, the first start runs
`npm ci --omit=dev`. If the panel blocks that, open the **Console** and run:

```bash
npm ci --omit=dev --no-audit --no-fund
```

Then restart the server.

## 5. Register the commands

The bot registers commands when the website asks it to sync, or you can do it
once from the Pterodactyl console:

```bash
node dist/deploy-commands.js
```

You should see eight commands:

```text
admin, ask, brief, help, site, stats, status, ticket
```

If they do not appear in Discord, wait a minute and reload the client. The
owner can also run `/admin sync` in the server.

## 6. Verify the integration

1. Run `/status` in Discord. It should answer with a live embed.
2. Run `/ask what does wrightyard build?`. It should answer through Groq.
3. Run `/brief I need a Discord bot for a gaming community with tickets and
   moderation.` It should return a private draft.
4. Open `https://wrightyard.vercel.app/api/status`. The bot should show
   `online: true` within 30 seconds.
5. Open a ticket from `#open-a-ticket` and close it to confirm the ledger and
   ticket log still work.

## 7. Keep exactly one process

A Discord gateway bot must run once. Before starting the Pterodactyl server,
stop the bot on the old machine. Two copies will fight over presence and
heartbeats, and Discord may disconnect both.

If the panel has a "restart on crash" or "auto restart" setting, leave it on.
Do not run a second copy as a backup.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN is missing` | The `.env` file is not in the server root, or the panel environment is empty. |
| `Gateway ready` never appears | The token is wrong, the bot is not invited, or the `Guilds` intent is off in the Discord Developer Portal. |
| Commands missing | Run `node dist/deploy-commands.js` and confirm `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is the Wrightyard guild. |
| Website says bot offline | `SITE_URL` must be `https://wrightyard.vercel.app`; `BOT_HEARTBEAT_SECRET` must match Vercel exactly. Check the console for `Website heartbeat accepted`. |
| `/ask` says AI is not wired | `GROQ_API_KEY` is missing or still the placeholder. |
| `npm ci` fails | Use Node 22+, check disk space, and run it from the console to see the full error. |
| Health check fails | The bot listens on `PORT` (default `8080`). If the panel assigns a different port, `start.sh` maps `SERVER_PORT` to `PORT` automatically. |

## Security

- Treat `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `MONGODB_URI`, `BOT_HEARTBEAT_SECRET`, and
  `GROQ_API_KEY` as passwords.
- The Groq key pasted during setup should be rotated once the new host is
  confirmed working. Create a fresh key at <https://console.groq.com/keys>,
  update `.env`, and restart.
- Never commit `.env`, logs, or the zip containing secrets.
